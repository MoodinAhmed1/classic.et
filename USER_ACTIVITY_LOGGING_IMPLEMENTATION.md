# User Activity Logging Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive user activity logging system that tracks all user activities for admin monitoring purposes. The system was previously missing the actual logging functionality, only having the database table and admin viewing capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Logging Function
- **Added `logUserActivity` function** in `back-end/src/admin-auth.ts`
- This function inserts records into the `user_activity_logs` table
- Captures: user ID, action, resource type, resource ID, details, IP address, user agent, and timestamp

### 2. Activity Logging Added To Key Endpoints

#### Authentication Activities
- **User Registration** (`/api/auth/register`) - logs `user_registered`
- **User Login** (`/api/auth/login`) - logs `user_login`
- **Email Verification** (`/api/auth/verify-email`) - logs `email_verified`
- **Password Reset** (`/api/auth/reset-password`) - logs `password_reset`
- **User Logout** (`/api/auth/logout`) - logs `user_logout`

#### Profile Management
- **Profile Update** (`/api/auth/update-profile`) - logs `profile_updated`
- **Password Update** (`/api/auth/update-password`) - logs `password_updated`

#### Link Management
- **Link Creation** (`/api/links`) - logs `link_created`
- **Link Update** (`/api/links/:id`) - logs `link_updated`
- **Link Deletion** (`/api/links/:id`) - logs `link_deleted`

#### Subscription & Analytics
- **Subscription Checkout** (`/api/subscription/checkout`) - logs `subscription_checkout`
- **Analytics Viewing** (`/api/analytics/global`) - logs `analytics_viewed`

### 3. Database Schema
The system uses the existing `user_activity_logs` table with the following structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_activity_logs (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    action TEXT NOT NULL,
    resource_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    resource_id TEXT,
    details TEXT, -- JSON string with additional details
    ip_address TEXT,
    user_agent TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

### 4. Admin Monitoring
- **Existing endpoint**: `/api/admin/user-activity-logs` - retrieves user activity logs
- **Frontend integration**: Admin dashboard already has activity logs page
- **Filtering capabilities**: By user ID, action, resource type, with pagination

## How It Works

### 1. Activity Capture
When a user performs an action, the system:
1. Executes the main business logic
2. Calls `logUserActivity()` with relevant details
3. Captures IP address and user agent from request headers
4. Stores activity in database with timestamp

### 2. Error Handling
- All logging calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Logging failures don't affect the main functionality
- Errors are logged to console for debugging

### 3. Data Captured
- **User Identification**: User ID from JWT token
- **Action Type**: Descriptive action name (e.g., `link_created`, `user_login`)
- **Resource Context**: What was affected (e.g., `link`, `user`, `subscription`)
- **Details**: JSON payload with relevant context data
- **Metadata**: IP address, user agent, timestamp

## Benefits

### 1. Security & Compliance
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of user actions
- **Security Monitoring**: Track suspicious activities
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements for user activity logging

### 2. Admin Insights
- **User Behavior**: Understand how users interact with the system
- **Troubleshooting**: Track down issues by user actions
- **Usage Patterns**: Identify popular features and user workflows

### 3. Business Intelligence
- **Feature Usage**: See which features are most used
- **User Engagement**: Track user activity levels
- **Conversion Tracking**: Monitor subscription and payment flows

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Activity Logs (Admin)
```typescript
// Get all user activity logs
const response = await adminApi.getUserActivityLogs({
  limit: 50,
  offset: 0
});

// Filter by specific user
const userLogs = await adminApi.getUserActivityLogs({
  userId: 'user-123',
  limit: 100
});

// Filter by action type
const loginLogs = await adminApi.getUserActivityLogs({
  action: 'user_login',
  limit: 100
});
```

### Sample Activity Log Entry
```json
{
  "id": "activity-123",
  "user_id": "user-456",
  "user_name": "John Doe",
  "user_email": "john@example.com",
  "action": "link_created",
  "resource_type": "link",
  "resource_id": "link-789",
  "details": "{\"shortCode\":\"abc123\",\"originalUrl\":\"https://example.com\"}",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Testing

A test script has been created at `back-end/test-user-activity.js` to verify the system setup.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Additional Activities to Log
- File uploads/downloads
- API rate limit hits
- Error occurrences
- Search queries
- Export operations

### 2. Advanced Analytics
- Activity heatmaps
- User session analysis
- Feature adoption metrics
- Anomaly detection

### 3. Real-time Monitoring
- Live activity feeds
- Alert system for suspicious activities
- Dashboard widgets

## Conclusion

The user activity logging system is now fully functional and will automatically capture all user activities across the platform. Admins can monitor user behavior, track system usage, and maintain comprehensive audit trails. The implementation is robust with proper error handling and doesn't impact the main application functionality.
